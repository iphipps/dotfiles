#Dot files
This is a list of the dotfiles that I use.  It also includes my terminal theme that I love.

#Usage 
Pull this repository.  Then run 
```
cd ~/dotfiles
chmod +x makesymlinks.sh
./makesymlinks.sh
``
which will create symlinks.

###Credits

Thanks to the makers of the the adventure theme.  I updated mine a bit.

Thanks to Michael Malley for the blog post and (install script)[https://github.com/michaeljsmalley/dotfiles] that I'm using here.
