# Dot files

This is a list of the dotfiles that I use. It also includes my terminal theme that I love.

# Usage

Pull this repository. Then run

```
cd ~/dotfiles
chmod +x makesymlinks.sh
./makesymlinks.sh
```

which will create symlinks.

### Credits

Thanks to the makers of the the adventure theme. I updated mine a bit.

Thanks to Michael Malley for the blog post and (install script)[https://github.com/michaeljsmalley/dotfiles] that I'm using here.
